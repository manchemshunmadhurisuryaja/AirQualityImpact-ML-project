# Results

- Feature engineering significantly impacted model performance.
- ANOVA-selected features led to the best performance with the optimized Neural Network achieving 98.4% accuracy.
- Using 15 features selected via ANOVA maintained optimal performance; a notable decline occurred below this threshold.
- A sharp drop in accuracy and other metrics was observed when reducing features to 13 or fewer.
- Retaining 15 features ensures balanced precision, recall, and F1-score, preserving the modelâ€™s ability to capture critical information.
- Detailed graphs and feature importance charts are available in the `Results/` folder.
